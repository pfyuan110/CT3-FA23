## Proposal
- Focus on the Visualization part.
- Connect ChatGPT with Processing to generate and display modified text from George Orwell's Animal Farm.
- Randomly replace some animal-related words with human-related words.
- Simply build the connection between physical part with Processing, such as some buttons. Keep the mechanism simple.

## P5JS

Press any key and any words ended with letter 's' will be replaced by word "human" and the background color will be changed.

### Iteration:
Press any key and there will be three kinds of text interaction. 
- Any words ended with letter 's' will be replaced by word "human" and the background color will be changed.
- Any words ended with letter 's' will be replaced by emoji related to human.
- Random animal emojis will fly around the canvas.

## API
I tried to use ChatGPT API in Node.js and it could be run in terminal.

The P5js was needed to be added into local server. I used Node.js to write it, as P5.js needs to be implemented within Node.js, which I still need to try. But there is no precedent for this :(
