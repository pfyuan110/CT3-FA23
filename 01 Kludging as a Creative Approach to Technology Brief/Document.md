## My Prototype
- Focus on the Visualization part.
- Connect ChatGPT with Processing to generate and display modified text from George Orwell's Animal Farm.
- Randomly replace some animal-related words with human-related words.
- Simply build the connection between physical part with Processing, such as some buttons. Keep the mechanism simple.
