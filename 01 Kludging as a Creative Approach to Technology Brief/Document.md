## Proposal
- Focus on the Visualization part.
- Connect ChatGPT with Processing to generate and display modified text from George Orwell's Animal Farm.
- Randomly replace some animal-related words with human-related words.
- Simply build the connection between physical part with Processing, such as some buttons. Keep the mechanism simple.

## P5JS

Press any key and random words will be replaced by word "human" and change the background color.

## API
I tried to use ChatGPT API in Node.js and it could be run in terminal.

I am still trying to make the user input part through server or use API in P5JS web editor.
